# Cat Requests (Using TypeScript and React)

This is a remake of a previous project of mine, [Cat Requests](https://github.com/Oakchris1955/cat-requests).
I originally wrote this using TkInter in Python, so you can probably imagine how bad this was.

## What is it?

This is basically a web interface that can be used to display the status code a webpage returns using [cute cat pictures](https://http.cat)

## Usage

Simply visit <https://oakchris1955.github.io/cat-requests-ts/>

## FAQ

- ### Why do I see network errors in my console?
  
  When the program attempts to make a HTTP request to the URL provided, if the response status code isn't 2xx, a network error is logged to the console. There is nothing I can do about it
